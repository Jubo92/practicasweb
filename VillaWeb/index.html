		<h2>House Blend, $1.49</h2>

		<p>Itâ€™s deceptively simple. A blend of fine Latin American beans roasted to a 
		glistening, dark chestnut color. Loaded with flavor, balancing tastes of nut 
		and cocoa, just a touch of sweetness from the roast.</p>

		<h2>Mocha Cafe Latte, $2.35</h2>

		<p>Any one of the above espresso + milk drinks with chocolate added.</p>

		<h2>Cappuccino, $1.89</h2>

		<p>A mixture espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. The milk is steamed 
		through a special high pressure steam pipe on the espresso machine.</p>

		<h2>Chai Tea, $1.85</h2>

		<p>A spicy drink made with black tea, spices, milk and honey.</p>
